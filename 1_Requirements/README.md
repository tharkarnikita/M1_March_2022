# Requirements

## Introduction

-   Recording data in any institution or place of work is typical, and more important for institution like Banks, where records and transaction is what drives the whole.
-   This topic was chosen as it allows me to implement data structures, and further helps me to get a deeper understanding of a structured programming language like C.

## Objective of the system

-   The main objective of the banking system is to provide a tool to efficiently record all data necessary, and also sort it.
-   The people using it only have to choose what they have to do, and enter the data,everything else is taken care of by the program.

## Features proposed in the current system

-   Two modes of logins provided namely admin and user.The 2 modes have different functionalities, elaborated below.

    -   User requires empty password
    -   Admin requires password 'admin' to login.

-   User mode consists of options:
    -   Create new Account, which requires the data
        -   Date of creation.
        -   Account number.
        -   Name of the Account holder.
        -   Date of birth.
        -   Age.
        -   Address.

            -   Fixed2 (for 2 years)
            -   Fixed3 (for 3 years)
    -   Update information of existing account. Which gives the choice of changing
        -   Address
        -   Phone
    -   For transations (Requires Account number). Gives you 2 choices:
        -   Deposit

    -   Check details of existing account. Further gives you the choice to search using:
        -   Account number or,
